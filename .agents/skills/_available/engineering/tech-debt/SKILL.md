Review and prioritize technical debt

## Purpose

Inventory technical debt, assess impact/effort, and prioritize what to address.

## Usage

- `/tech-debt` - Full tech debt review
- `/tech-debt [component]` - Focus on specific system/component

---

## Steps

1. **Search for tech debt mentions:**
   - 04-Projects/
   - Meeting notes with keywords: "tech debt", "refactor", "technical debt", "needs cleanup"
   - Code review discussions

2. **Extract for each item:**
   - Description
   - Component/system affected
   - Impact (velocity, stability, security)
   - Estimated effort
   - Age (when first noted)

3. **Categorize by impact:**
   - Critical: Blocking work or security risk
   - High: Slowing velocity significantly
   - Medium: Creating friction
   - Low: Nice to have

4. **Generate prioritization matrix:**
   - High impact + low effort = Do now
   - High impact + high effort = Plan for
   - Low impact + low effort = Quick wins
   - Low impact + high effort = Defer
